This code snippet demonstrates a potential issue in PHP related to the usage of `json_decode` with the `true` flag. When the JSON string contains an invalid or unexpected value, such as a string where a boolean is expected, `json_decode` may return an unexpected result instead of throwing an error.

```php
$jsonString = '{"isValid": "true"}';
$decodedJson = json_decode($jsonString, true);

var_dump($decodedJson);
```

This code will result in an array, instead of throwing an error as one might expect.  The `"true"` string will become a string, making it difficult to verify validity.

This can lead to unexpected behavior and make debugging more difficult.  A robust approach should involve proper error handling and input validation.
