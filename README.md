This repository demonstrates a subtle but important bug in PHP's `json_decode` function when used with the `true` flag.  The issue occurs when the JSON string is invalid or contains unexpected data types. Instead of throwing an error or returning `null`, `json_decode` may proceed to parse the JSON string producing unexpected results which can lead to difficult-to-track logic errors. The `bug.php` file shows the problematic behavior, while `bugSolution.php` offers a robust solution.
